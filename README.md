Exercises in the "Principles and Practice Using C++" by Stroustrup
==============
Created using Visual Studio Express 2013, these exercises are from Chapters 12&ndash;16 and deal with the GUI and graphics side of things, while teaching fundamentals of polymorphism in C++. A guide to set up FLTK with VS 2013 can be found [here](http://bewuethr.github.io/installing-fltk-133-under-visual-studio/).
